THOUGHTS
--------

- Code is rather ugly.
    - Maybe enumerate the various return types instead?
    - Maybe remove the templates and go back to the initial approach
    of writing the C++ code incrementally


TODO
----

Add missing test cases for remaining return values

Add C++ tests that validate that the generated C++ code is correct!
